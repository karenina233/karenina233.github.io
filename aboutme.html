    <h1>Nina</h1>
    <p>I was born in Utah, raised between there and Brazil, and I've lived most of my adult life in California—which is
        where I'm at currently. <br>

    </p>
    <p>I am 27 years old, married, and have 2 little boys, ages 5 and 3. We recently moved back to California after
        living in Portugal for a couple years. <br>
        My husband is half Portuguese, half American, and I am half Brazilian, half American. All 4 of us speak both
        languages, so that has been really fun!<br>
        I am currently going to school for the purpose of learning more about finance. I would be interested in working
        as a financial analyst, but <br>
        more immediately, I want to better manage our own finances (retirement, investments, emergency funds, taxes,
        etc.). <br>
    </p>
    <p>I am taking this class for some more specific goals—I would like to build blog style websites, using SEO to
        generate traffic, to eventually be able<br>
        to sell different products. I started building one using WordPress, but I realized I know absolutely nothing
        about building websites or computers in general, <br>
        and I feel strongly that at least a general understanding of CIT is a necessity in our time. I'm actually
        ecstatic to begin learning, or more <br>
        importantly, <em>understanding</em> some of these concepts. I have to admit, I have been embarrassingly slow at
        understanding what is being asked. <br>
        All the jargon is so foreign. I'm looking foward to becoming more profficient.

        Both photos were taken over Christmas. </p>
